Frankly, I'm not happy with the prospect of moving elsewhere, but the idea that you'll need a completely separate account to continue using something that was promised to remain wholly independent is enough to send all of us away. This is simply not a reasonable option for us and I know a majority of people on this platform believe the same. Your established communities and most avid supporters don't want this, I'm sure your devs don't want this, nobody wants this.",

That is, until May 31st, where all my trust was lost in the platform. On July 15th, all my memories on this previously amazing platform will be wiped off, servers will have switched and the entire former community will be gone. All of this, because of a corporate decision. Yes, I will miss the platform, but it has gone too far and my trust has been lost.",

We also loved the fact we could have a custom URL without spending a ton of money on boosts or Partnership (which isn't possible on Discord anymore). While we eventually got a Guilded Partnership, that wasn't what we were aiming for. We just wanted a community platform that offered everything we wanted and more, at minimal to no cost. Guilded offered that to us. But 99% of our community has ZERO interest in Roblox, and refuses to make an account.

They don't require login requirements, but the problem is if an account is banned, users can't access it or use Roblox. I hope Guilded and Roblox listen to this. If not, people might boycott Guilded because they are deleting accounts and shutting down servers. I hope they listen, or else they don't care.
